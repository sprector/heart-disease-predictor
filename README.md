# heart-disease-predictor
Using machine learning classifiers to predict whether a patient has a heart disease or not.

Google Colab notebook URL: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Fnn43bLZcxTbNR-fwocfFXRWynNgP8bR#scrollTo=BHthyBtXFR48

In this project, I used the heart.csv dataset from Ali Rezaei on Kaggle. Here are some of the features: 

Dataset Information:

age: The age of the patient.
sex: Gender of the patient (0: female, 1: male).
cp: Type of chest pain.
trestbps: Resting blood pressure.
chol: Serum cholesterol.
fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl.
restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results.
thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved.
exang: Exercise induced angina.
oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

Models included: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM Classifier, KNN Classifier

Thank you!
